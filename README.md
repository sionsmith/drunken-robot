Java test
=========

Please fork this repo and follow the instructions below to complete the test.

### The Sprint

The sprint is arround 1.5hours long. It begins when you received this repo and will end once you issue a pull request back to it. Please make commits as you go (> 1, < 100). 

### The Story

As a separate application, I would like to be able to add, retrieve, remove and update *Cars* in your application via a RESTFul API.

### The Acceptance Criteria

- Unless the README contains alternative steps to expose your endpoint over http, we will expect a WAR file (which we will test using a Wildfly application server).
- If the story needs to be broken down to fit into the sprint it is wise to do so. 
  Priority order is:
  1. add
  2. retrieve 
  3. remove
  4. update
- My *Car* has the following attributes:
  - Id*
  - Make
  - Model
  - Year of manufacture
  - Entry Date*
- We do not require persistent storage (in-memory is fine).

*generated by the application on entry

## Extras
- Add/stub-out unit tests
- Add/stub-out integration tests
- Add persistent storage of any kind

## Limitations

You can use whatever online resources you want (aside from copy-pasting large chunks of code, obviously).

You are encouraged to use any frameworks etc you feel comfortable with.
